- CD into the `frontend` directory
- Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
- Start the frontend by running `npm run dev`

## Backend

In order to start the backend, you'll need to do the following after cloning the repository:

- CD into the `backend` directory
- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`)
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Congrats! You're all set to start using the application.
